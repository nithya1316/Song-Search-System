# Song-Search-System
The main idea of this project is for users to store their favorite songs and to search songs by their title, album, and artist. For instance, a user's input to the search engine could be:
•	song name lonely, OR
•	song name lonely and artist name, OR
•	song name lonely, artist name and album title
The search engine gives users a list of songs with song title, album name, year the song was leased, artist name, album title, and the company name that produced the song’s album.
What users can do?
1.	add and delete songs, artists, and albums by their ID.
2.	add songs of already existing (or registered on the website) artists and albums.
3.	If they want to add songs of artists/albums that does not exist on the website, they should add artist/album first.
4.	search for a song by its title, artist, or album
5.	see song ID, artist ID, and album ID.
